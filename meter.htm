                            <div class="mainstory">
                                <p>
                                    Just this morning, while I was ruminating over my past, I remembered one very funny<br> but strange
                                    thing that happened in my church district some eighteen years ago- how<br> Mr. Dike learnt a lesson for life.
                                    But who might this lesson have come from?<br> It happened like this.......
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Every year, between the month of August and September, we held a sort of a building<br>
                                    project/harvest thanksgiving event. Of course as a tradition, every family was expected<br>
                                    to come prepared for all the festivities which included donating towards the new church<br>
                                    building as well as a harvest for the pastors' welfare. Usually, people danced out <br>
                                    to give their donations or stood up to announced theirs.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Mr. Dike happens to be one of the well-to-dos. But he never liked giving. "All these
                                <br>pastors and their give give give wahala," he always said to his wife. All her efforts to<br>
                                    change his behaviour fell on deaf ears as he would purposely fall asleep when it's time <br>
                                    to give.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    One fateful August, which would mark the fifth and final year for the completion of the<br>
                                    church building, came another "giving time". As usual, Mr Dike went into his 'model'<br>
                                    sleep so as to prevent anybody from expecting him to give. Unfortunately for him, <br>
                                    after the givings were over and while the preacher was giving his sermon, a wooden<br>
                                    support that had broken off its rafter, crashed upon gentle sleeping Mr Dike to<br>
                                    everyone's oblivion. "Yeeeeh! Chineke.Five Hundred and Fifty Thousand Naira",<br>
                                    he screamed rising on his feet.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The entire church was in confusion. Everyone was asking,'what happened?'. Being an<br>
                                    experienced housewife who knew her husband well, Mrs Dike quickly jumped to her<br> 
                                    feet, dug into her husband's purse and brought out a cheque of the same amount<br>
                                    being the money they agreed to give from home and then gave it to the church<br>
                                    with a loud "Praise the Lord"
                                    <br>
                                    Leaving Mr Dike to writhe in his own pain, the congregation wondered at everything<br>
                                    while most laughed their hearts out upon 'coding' what must have transpired.<br>
                                    No one ever slept during thanksgiving or any fundraising service again.
